# Filemanager


Linux only.

Currently only parses information from a ls system-call and thus only works in enviroments ls exists as a command.

.filename is read as a hidden file.

filename/ is read as a folder.

All other files as currently unidentified.


Has a basic CLI to navigate a folder structure to enter/exit folders and filter out unwanted (hidden) files.
